Asteroids! Spaceships! Interstellar Drifting! Cosmic Drift is an asteroids-like game created with HTML5's canvas element.

## Controls
\< (left-arrow): rotate ship left

\> (right-arrow): rotate ship right

\^ (up-arrow): accelerate forwards

## A note on the Controls
In space, no one can hear you brake... there's no slowing down in Cosmic Drift, only applying momentum in the opposite direction, in classic Asteroids style. It's a challenge, but a fun one, I think. Enjoy!
